# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Form Generation feature transforms AgentForm from a traditional form builder into an intelligent form creation platform. This feature allows users to generate complete, professional forms by either describing their requirements in natural language or uploading documents (PDFs, Markdown, text files). The system uses advanced AI to analyze content, understand intent, and create structured forms with appropriate question types, validation rules, and user experience optimizations.

This feature represents a core differentiator for AgentForm, positioning it as an "Agentic Pioneer" in the form building space by leveraging the SuperAgent framework to create truly intelligent form generation workflows.

**IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:** During the construction of this feature, the implementation MUST follow the detailed blueprint provided in the TODO.md document at all times. The TODO.md contains precise architectural specifications, class definitions, method implementations, and UI components that have been carefully designed to ensure no details are omitted. All code generation and implementation tasks should reference and adhere to the specific patterns, naming conventions, and technical approaches outlined in the TODO.md blueprint.
