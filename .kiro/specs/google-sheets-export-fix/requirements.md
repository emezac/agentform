# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google Sheets export functionality is not working correctly. While the export job is being enqueued successfully (as shown in the logs), the actual form responses are not being exported to Google Sheets. Users can trigger the export process, but the spreadsheet either remains empty or only contains headers without the actual response data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a form owner, I want to export my form responses to Google Sheets, so that I can analyze and share the data with my team using familiar spreadsheet tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the export button THEN the system SHALL successfully export all form responses to Google Sheets
2. WHEN the export completes THEN the Google Sheet SHALL contain both headers and all response data
3. WHEN there are multiple responses THEN each response SHALL appear as a separate row in the spreadsheet
4. WHEN responses contain different question types THEN the system SHALL format each answer appropriately for spreadsheet display
5. WHEN the export job runs THEN it SHALL complete without errors and provide feedback to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and debug Google Sheets export issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an export job is triggered THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the export process
2. WHEN an export fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error messages and context
3. WHEN debugging export issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about data formatting and API calls
4. WHEN monitoring exports THEN the system SHALL track success/failure rates and performance metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Google Sheets export to handle various data types and edge cases, so that the export works reliably across different form configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responses contain text answers THEN they SHALL be exported as plain text
2. WHEN responses contain multiple choice answers THEN they SHALL be exported with readable labels
3. WHEN responses contain file uploads THEN they SHALL be exported with appropriate file references
4. WHEN responses are empty or null THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without breaking the export
5. WHEN forms have dynamic questions THEN all question types SHALL be exported correctly
