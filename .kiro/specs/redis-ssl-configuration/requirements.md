# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing Redis connection failures in the Heroku production environment due to SSL certificate verification issues. This is preventing critical functionality like user creation, notifications, and ActionCable features from working properly. The error indicates that the Redis connection is failing with "certificate verify failed (self-signed certificate in certificate chain)" when trying to connect to the Heroku Redis add-on.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Redis connections to work reliably in production, so that all application features dependent on Redis (ActionCable, Sidekiq, caching) function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to Redis in production THEN it SHALL successfully establish a secure SSL connection without certificate verification errors
2. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL be able to send notifications via ActionCable without Redis connection failures
3. WHEN background jobs are queued THEN Sidekiq SHALL be able to connect to Redis successfully
4. WHEN the application uses caching THEN Redis SHALL be accessible for cache operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Redis configuration for different environments, so that the application works consistently across development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development THEN it SHALL use local Redis without SSL
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL use Heroku Redis with proper SSL configuration
3. WHEN Redis configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL handle SSL verification appropriately for each environment
4. WHEN Redis connection fails THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback gracefully where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the superadmin creation task to work reliably, so that I can access the admin interface without Redis-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the superadmin creation task THEN it SHALL complete successfully without Redis connection errors
2. WHEN the superadmin user is created THEN notifications SHALL be sent or gracefully skipped if Redis is unavailable
3. WHEN Redis is temporarily unavailable THEN critical operations like user creation SHALL still succeed
4. WHEN Redis connectivity is restored THEN all dependent features SHALL resume normal operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for Redis connectivity issues, so that the application remains stable even when Redis is temporarily unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis connection fails THEN the application SHALL log the error appropriately
2. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN non-critical features SHALL degrade gracefully
3. WHEN Redis connectivity is restored THEN the application SHALL automatically reconnect
4. WHEN Redis errors occur THEN they SHALL not prevent critical business operations from completing
