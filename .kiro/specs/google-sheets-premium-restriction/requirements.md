# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of premium plan restrictions for Google Sheets integration functionality. Currently, Google Sheets integration is available to all users, but it should be restricted to premium subscribers only as part of the tiered feature model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Premium Plan Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Google Sheets integration to be available only to premium users, so that we can maintain proper feature tiering and monetization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a basic plan user attempts to access Google Sheets integration THEN the system SHALL display a premium upgrade prompt
2. WHEN a basic plan user tries to create a Google Sheets integration THEN the system SHALL return an authorization error with upgrade information
3. WHEN a basic plan user tries to export to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL block the action and show premium requirement message
4. WHEN a premium user accesses Google Sheets integration THEN the system SHALL allow full functionality as before
5. WHEN a user's subscription downgrades from premium to basic THEN existing Google Sheets integrations SHALL be disabled but preserved

### Requirement 2: User Interface Premium Restrictions

**User Story:** As a basic plan user, I want to see clear information about premium features, so that I understand what I need to upgrade to access Google Sheets integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a basic plan user views the form builder THEN the Google Sheets panel SHALL show a premium upgrade prompt instead of integration controls
2. WHEN a basic plan user hovers over disabled Google Sheets features THEN the system SHALL display tooltips explaining the premium requirement
3. WHEN a basic plan user clicks on Google Sheets upgrade prompt THEN the system SHALL redirect to the subscription upgrade page
4. WHEN a premium user views the form builder THEN the Google Sheets panel SHALL show full functionality as currently implemented
5. WHEN displaying premium features THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with other premium-restricted features

### Requirement 3: API and Backend Restrictions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API endpoints to properly validate premium access for Google Sheets functionality, so that the restriction cannot be bypassed through direct API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a basic plan user makes API calls to Google Sheets endpoints THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden with premium requirement details
2. WHEN validating Google Sheets operations THEN the system SHALL check user subscription status before processing
3. WHEN a user's subscription changes THEN existing Google Sheets integrations SHALL be updated accordingly
4. WHEN background jobs process Google Sheets sync THEN the system SHALL verify premium status before execution
5. WHEN premium validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Existing Integration Handling

**User Story:** As a user who downgrades from premium to basic, I want my Google Sheets integrations to be preserved but disabled, so that I can reactivate them if I upgrade again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a premium user downgrades to basic THEN existing Google Sheets integrations SHALL be marked as inactive but not deleted
2. WHEN a basic user upgrades to premium THEN previously created Google Sheets integrations SHALL be automatically reactivated
3. WHEN an integration is disabled due to downgrade THEN auto-sync SHALL be turned off and manual exports SHALL be blocked
4. WHEN displaying disabled integrations THEN the system SHALL show clear status and upgrade prompts
5. WHEN reactivating integrations after upgrade THEN the system SHALL restore previous configuration and settings

### Requirement 5: Consistent Premium Feature Patterns

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want Google Sheets restrictions to follow the same patterns as other premium features, so that users have a consistent experience across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing premium restrictions THEN the system SHALL use the same validation methods as payment questions and other premium features
2. WHEN displaying premium prompts THEN the system SHALL use consistent messaging and styling with existing premium features
3. WHEN handling subscription changes THEN the system SHALL follow the same patterns as other premium feature restrictions
4. WHEN users upgrade/downgrade THEN Google Sheets access SHALL be updated using the same mechanisms as other premium features
5. WHEN showing feature availability THEN Google Sheets SHALL be listed consistently in premium plan comparisons
