# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a critical production error where the `page` method from Kaminari pagination gem is not available, causing a NoMethodError when users try to access form responses. This is preventing users from viewing their form responses, which is a core functionality of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a form owner, I want to view my form responses without encountering server errors, so that I can analyze the data collected from my forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the form responses page THEN the system SHALL display the responses without throwing a NoMethodError
2. WHEN there are many responses THEN the system SHALL handle large datasets efficiently without performance issues
3. WHEN the responses are displayed THEN they SHALL be ordered by creation date (newest first)
4. IF pagination is available THEN the system SHALL use it to improve performance
5. IF pagination is not available THEN the system SHALL implement a fallback mechanism

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be resilient to missing dependencies, so that core functionality remains available even when optional features fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pagination gem is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to showing all results
2. WHEN there are performance concerns with large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement basic limiting mechanisms
3. WHEN debugging pagination issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
4. IF the pagination gem becomes available again THEN the system SHALL automatically use it without code changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure Kaminari is properly configured in all environments, so that pagination works consistently across development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN Kaminari SHALL be properly installed and configured
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL verify that pagination dependencies are available
3. WHEN pagination is used THEN it SHALL work consistently across all environments
4. IF there are configuration issues THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
