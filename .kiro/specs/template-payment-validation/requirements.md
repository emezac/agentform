# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Template Payment Validation feature addresses a critical gap in the form generation workflow when users create forms from templates that contain payment questions. Currently, when a user generates a form from a template with payment questions and attempts to publish it immediately, the system fails with a generic validation error without providing clear guidance on how to resolve the issue.

This feature ensures that users have a smooth, guided experience when working with payment-enabled templates, with proactive validation, clear error messaging, and actionable guidance to complete the necessary setup steps.

## Requirements
