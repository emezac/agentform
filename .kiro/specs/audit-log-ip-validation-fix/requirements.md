# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the admin user management system where user deletion fails due to IP address validation errors in audit logs. The error "Validation failed: Ip address is invalid" occurs when the AdminSecurity concern attempts to create audit logs with invalid IP address values during user deletion operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a superadmin, I want to be able to delete users through the admin interface without encountering IP address validation errors, so that I can properly manage user accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a superadmin attempts to delete a user THEN the system SHALL successfully delete the user without IP address validation errors
2. WHEN the AdminSecurity concern logs admin actions THEN the system SHALL handle invalid IP addresses gracefully
3. WHEN request.remote_ip returns an invalid IP address format THEN the system SHALL sanitize or default the IP address value
4. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL validate IP addresses before saving and handle validation failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want audit logs to be created reliably even when IP address information is unavailable or invalid, so that security monitoring continues to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an IP address is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL use a default placeholder value like "unknown" or "invalid"
2. WHEN audit log creation fails due to IP validation THEN the system SHALL log the error but not interrupt the main operation
3. WHEN IP address validation fails THEN the system SHALL still create the audit log with a sanitized IP value
4. WHEN the system encounters IPv6 addresses or other edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling in the audit logging system, so that audit log failures don't break critical user operations like account deletion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit log creation fails THEN the system SHALL catch the exception and log it without affecting the main operation
2. WHEN IP address validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages in the application logs
3. WHEN the AdminSecurity concern encounters errors THEN the system SHALL continue processing the request
4. WHEN debugging IP validation issues THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging information to identify the root cause

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want consistent and reliable audit logging for all admin actions, so that I can properly monitor and investigate administrative activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin actions are performed THEN the system SHALL create audit logs with valid IP addresses or appropriate defaults
2. WHEN IP addresses are sanitized or defaulted THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the audit log details
3. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL ensure all required fields are properly validated
4. WHEN reviewing audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about IP address handling and any sanitization performed
