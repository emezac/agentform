3. WHEN parameters are processed THEN the test SHALL verify parameter validation and sanitization
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the test SHALL verify data persistence and retrieval
5. WHEN redirects happen THEN the test SHALL verify correct redirect targets
6. WHEN JSON responses are returned THEN the test SHALL verify response structure and content

### Requirement 4: SuperAgent Component Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specialized testing for SuperAgent workflows and agents, so that AI-powered features work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is executed THEN the test SHALL verify step execution order and conditions
2. WHEN LLM tasks are called THEN the test SHALL mock AI responses and verify processing
3. WHEN agents coordinate workflows THEN the test SHALL verify agent behavior and workflow triggering
4. WHEN background jobs are queued THEN the test SHALL verify job scheduling and execution
5. WHEN streaming updates occur THEN the test SHALL verify real-time communication
6. WHEN error conditions arise THEN the test SHALL verify error handling and recovery

### Requirement 5: API Testing Framework

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want reliable API endpoints, so that external integrations work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the test SHALL verify authentication mechanisms
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the test SHALL verify request/response formats
3. WHEN API rate limiting is active THEN the test SHALL verify throttling behavior
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the test SHALL verify error response formats
5. WHEN API versioning is used THEN the test SHALL verify backward compatibility
6. WHEN API documentation exists THEN the test SHALL verify documentation accuracy

### Requirement 6: Integration Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want integration tests, so that component interactions work correctly in realistic scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms are created and submitted THEN the test SHALL verify end-to-end form processing
2. WHEN AI analysis is triggered THEN the test SHALL verify workflow execution and result storage
3. WHEN background jobs process THEN the test SHALL verify job completion and side effects
4. WHEN database transactions occur THEN the test SHALL verify data consistency and rollback behavior
5. WHEN external services are called THEN the test SHALL verify integration points with mocking
6. WHEN user authentication flows execute THEN the test SHALL verify complete authentication cycles

### Requirement 7: Performance Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want performance benchmarks, so that the application meets scalability requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries execute THEN the test SHALL verify query performance and N+1 prevention
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the test SHALL verify response time requirements
3. WHEN background jobs process THEN the test SHALL verify processing time limits
4. WHEN memory usage is measured THEN the test SHALL verify memory efficiency
5. WHEN concurrent requests are made THEN the test SHALL verify system stability
6. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the test SHALL verify scalability limits

### Requirement 8: Security Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want security tests, so that the application is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN the test SHALL verify protection against injection attacks
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the test SHALL verify session security and token validation
3. WHEN authorization is checked THEN the test SHALL verify access control enforcement
4. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the test SHALL verify encryption and data protection
5. WHEN file uploads are processed THEN the test SHALL verify file type and size validation
6. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the test SHALL verify CORS and security headers

### Requirement 9: Test Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable test data, so that tests are consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need data THEN the system SHALL provide factory-generated test objects
2. WHEN test isolation is required THEN the system SHALL ensure clean database state between tests
