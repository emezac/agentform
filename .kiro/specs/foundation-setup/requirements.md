# Requirements: AgentForm Foundation & Core Setup

## Introduction

This document specifies the initial requirements for establishing the foundational infrastructure, core architecture, and primary data models for the AgentForm application. The focus is on creating a robust and scalable base upon which all future features will be built.

Requirements are defined as user stories with acceptance criteria in EARS notation.

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a **Developer**, I need a modern and well-configured Rails application environment, so that I can focus on building business logic for AgentForm efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** the Rails application is configured, **THEN** the system **SHALL** use Rails 7.1+ with PostgreSQL as its database.
2.  **WHEN** the application is configured, **THEN** the system **SHALL** integrate Tailwind CSS with a custom configuration for styling.
3.  **WHEN** AI functionality is integrated, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include and configure the SuperAgent gem.
4.  **WHEN** the frontend is implemented, **THEN** the system **SHALL** utilize Turbo Streams for real-time interface updates.
5.  **WHEN** the application is prepared for different stages, **THEN** the system **SHALL** have specific configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a **Developer**, I need a clear and scalable application architecture that supports agent-based development and simplifies the construction of complex features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** the architecture is defined, **THEN** the system **SHALL** follow the `Controllers → Agents → Workflows → Tasks (LLM/DB/Stream) → Services` pattern.
2.  **WHEN** the application is initialized, **THEN** the system **SHALL** establish base classes for each architectural layer (e.g., `ApplicationController`, `ApplicationAgent`, `ApplicationWorkflow`).
3.  **WHEN** errors occur, **THEN** the system **SHALL** implement a centralized mechanism for error handling and logging.
4.  **WHEN** data is processed for API responses, **THEN** the system **SHALL** apply a consistent serialization schema.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a **Developer**, I need a robust and flexible database schema to efficiently store and manage all application data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** the database is initialized, **THEN** the system **SHALL** enable the `pgcrypto` extension to support UUIDs as primary identifiers.
2.  **WHEN** users are managed, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include a `Users` table with fields for email, encrypted password, name, role (`user`, `admin`, `premium`), preferences, and AI settings.
3.  **WHEN** forms are created, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include a `Forms` table with fields for name, description, status, a unique `share_token`, a reference to the user, and JSON fields for various configurations (e.g., `form_settings`, `ai_configuration`, `style_configuration`).
4.  **WHEN** form questions are designed, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include a `FormQuestions` table that supports ordering (`position`) and conditional logic.
5.  **WHEN** form responses are collected, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include a `FormResponses` table with fields to store AI-assisted analysis data.
6.  **WHEN** individual question answers are stored, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include a `QuestionResponses` table for granular tracking of metadata.
7.  **WHEN** form performance is monitored, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include a `FormAnalytics` table to store performance metrics.
8.  **WHEN** dynamic questions are generated by AI, **THEN** the system **SHALL** include a `DynamicQuestions` table to manage these follow-up questions.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a **Developer**, I need the AgentForm application to efficiently and reliably manage background tasks using the SuperAgent gem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** SuperAgent is configured, **THEN** the system **SHALL** specify the LLM provider, a default LLM model, a workflow timeout, and A2A server settings.
2.  **WHEN** asynchronous tasks are processed, **THEN** the system **SHALL** use Sidekiq with multiple dedicated queues (e.g., `default`, `ai_processing`, `integrations`, `analytics`).
3.  **WHEN** data persistence or a message broker is required for asynchronous tasks, **THEN** the system **SHALL** be configured to use Redis for caching and sessions.
4.  **WHEN** a background job fails, **THEN** the system **SHALL** apply robust retry policies and error handling for Sidekiq jobs.
5.  **WHEN** background tasks are managed, **THEN** the system **SHALL** implement monitoring and alerting for the status of Sidekiq queues.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a **User** and **Administrator**, I need a secure and flexible authentication and authorization system to control access to the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** a user registers or signs in, **THEN** the system **SHALL** use Devise for authentication, integrated with the custom `User` model.
2.  **WHEN** user permissions are managed, **THEN** the system **SHALL** implement role-based authorization (`user`, `premium`, `admin`).
3.  **WHEN** the API is accessed, **THEN** the system **SHALL** support an authentication system based on API tokens.
4.  **WHEN** user sessions are established, **THEN** the system **SHALL** implement secure session management.
