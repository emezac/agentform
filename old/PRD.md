# AgentForm: Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

AgentForm is an AI-powered form builder that leverages the SuperAgent workflow framework to create intelligent, adaptive forms that go beyond static questionnaires. Unlike traditional form builders like Typeform, AgentForm creates truly agentic experiences where forms can think, adapt, and respond intelligently to user inputs in real-time.

## Market Opportunity

**Problem**: Current form builders rely on static, pre-defined logic. Creators must anticipate every possible user path and manually configure conditional logic, resulting in:
- Generic, one-size-fits-all experiences
- Limited personalization capabilities  
- Manual data processing and analysis
- No intelligent follow-up or adaptation

**Solution**: AgentForm transforms forms into intelligent agents that can understand context, generate dynamic questions, analyze responses, and take automated actions based on AI insights.

## Product Vision

"Forms that think for themselves" - AgentForm creates conversational experiences where each form is an intelligent agent capable of understanding, adapting, and responding to users in ways that feel natural and personalized.

## Core Value Proposition

1. **Intelligent Adaptation**: Forms that modify themselves based on user responses using AI
2. **Real-time Analysis**: Instant insights and sentiment analysis during form completion
3. **Autonomous Actions**: Forms that can trigger workflows and integrations automatically
4. **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Forms that can interact with other systems intelligently

## Target Users

### Primary: Growth Teams & Marketers
- Lead qualification forms that adapt based on company size and industry
- Customer feedback forms that trigger appropriate responses automatically
- Event registration that personalizes follow-up communications

### Secondary: HR & Operations Teams  
- Job application processes that adapt questions based on role and experience
- Employee feedback systems that trigger interventions when needed
- Onboarding flows that personalize based on department and role

### Tertiary: Customer Success Teams
- Support intake forms that intelligently route and prioritize tickets
- Customer health check surveys that trigger retention workflows
- Feature request collection with automatic prioritization

## Key Features

### Tier 1: Core Typeform Parity (MVP)

#### Conversational Flow Engine
- One-question-at-a-time interface with smooth transitions
- Built on SuperAgent's WorkflowDefinition with TurboStreamTask for real-time UI updates
